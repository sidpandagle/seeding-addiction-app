# 🧠 Architecture Analysis & Performance Optimization Plan

---

## 🔍 Current Issues Identified

### 🚨 **Critical Bottlenecks**

#### 1. `useJourneyStats` Hook – Multiple Database Calls

* **Location:** `src/hooks/useJourneyStats.ts`
* **Problem:** Each component using this hook triggers its own `getJourneyStart()` call.
* **Impact:** Home, History, and child components all re-query the same data.
* **Effect:** 3–5 redundant DB queries per render cycle.

#### 2. Excessive Re-renders from State Changes

* `LiveTimer` updates every second → triggers parent re-renders.
* `MotivationCard` rotates every 10 seconds → cascades updates.
* Multiple screens use `useJourneyStats()` → all recompute on relapse changes.

#### 3. Database Query Performance

* No caching for frequently accessed data.
* `getJourneyStart()` called multiple times per screen.
* Relapse sorting occurs in several places (not memoized).

#### 4. Zustand Store Inefficiencies

* Components subscribe to the entire store instead of specific slices.
* No memoized computed values (e.g., latest relapse timestamp).

#### 5. Reanimated Animations Running Continuously

* Circular progress animates even on <0.5% value changes.
* Growth icon glow runs continuously.
* Multiple animated components update in parallel.

---

### ⚠️ **Medium Issues**

#### 1. Tab Navigation Performance

* All tabs mount simultaneously (no lazy loading).
* Background tabs continue running timers and calculations.
* `useTabFocus` hook exists but is **not used** in critical components.

#### 2. Calendar Component Performance

* `react-native-calendars` re-renders on theme changes.
* `markedDates` recalculated every render despite memoization.
* Large relapse arrays processed without pagination.

#### 3. Memory Leaks

* Multiple `setInterval` calls lack cleanup.
* Achievement check logic with refs still runs every second.
* Theme store debounce timers not properly cleared.

---

### 🪶 **Minor Issues**

#### 1. AsyncStorage Persistence

* Theme changes trigger immediate (though debounced) writes.
* No batching for grouped state updates.

#### 2. Component Memoization Incomplete

* `React.memo` used inconsistently or with poor dependencies.
* Missing `useCallback` → callbacks recreated on each render.

## 🎯 Optimization Strategy

---

### **Phase 1: Critical Performance Fixes (Immediate Impact)**

#### 🧩 Centralize Journey Start Query

* Create a single global state for journey start time.
* Load once at app initialization → cache in Zustand store.
* Remove redundant `getJourneyStart()` calls.

#### ⚙️ Optimize `useJourneyStats` Hook

* Move journey start to global store.
* Memoize computed values.
* Expose lightweight selectors for specific data needs.

#### 🧭 Implement Tab-Aware Rendering

* Use `useTabFocus` in Home and History screens.
* Pause `LiveTimer` when tab not focused.
* Skip heavy calculations for invisible tabs.

#### 🧠 Add Computed Store Selectors

Add memoized selectors to `relapseStore` for:

* Latest relapse timestamp
* Relapse count
* Sorted relapses

→ Prevents redundant array operations.

#### ⏱ Optimize `LiveTimer` Component

* Prevent parent re-renders by isolating updates.
* Use `useSharedValue` (Reanimated) instead of React state.
* Update only when the tab is focused.

---

### **Phase 2: Database & State Management (Medium Priority)**

#### 💾 Add Query Caching Layer

* Implement lightweight in-memory cache for frequent queries.
* Cache: journey start, relapse counts, streak calculations.
* Invalidate only on data mutation.

#### 📊 Optimize `relapseStore`

* Pre-sort relapses once when loading.
* Maintain sorted order during CRUD ops.
* Add computed properties for common metrics.

#### 🧱 Reduce Database Query Frequency

* Batch writes using transactions.
* Debounce non-critical queries.
* Use SQLite triggers for computed columns.

---

### **Phase 3: Component Optimization (Fine-Tuning)**

#### 📅 Optimize Calendar Component

* Implement virtual scrolling for large date ranges.
* Lazy-load marked dates (only current month).
* Cache processed relapse data.

#### 🎞 Animation Performance

* Reduce frame rate for background effects.
* Use `useNativeDriver` for all animations.
* Disable animations when battery saver is on.

#### 🔁 Complete Callback Memoization

* Wrap all callbacks with `useCallback`.
* Maintain stable references for child components.
* Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations.

---

### **Phase 4: Advanced Optimizations (Long-Term)**

#### 🧭 Lazy Load Tabs

* Implement lazy mounting for tab screens.
* Preload only adjacent tabs.
* Unmount distant tabs to reduce memory load.

#### ⚙️ Web Worker for Stats

* Offload complex calculations to background threads.
* Keep UI thread smooth and responsive.

#### 🗄 Database Indexing

* Add indexes for timestamp-based queries.
* Optimize frequent query paths.
* Use prepared statements for consistency.
